# Two-axis Writing Robot
  This type of robot relies on screws for transmission and stepper motors for drive. This robor use Arduino uno to control the motor and other transducers to achieve drawing and writing. The following shows how this robot looks like. If you want to know its 3D structure, you could find its structure in .step format in [here](Two-axis/display).
