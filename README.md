# IA_WritingRobot
&emsp;&emsp; In this project, with the help of my teacher, we used some machine parts to build four kinds of writing robot: two-axis, three-axis, four-wheel, and three-wheel. Then, I based on interpolation algorithm to devised suitable control algorithms to allow those four robots to drawing and writing some complex pictures and charcters.
